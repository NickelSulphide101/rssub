</ul><p>In delivering its verdict, the Ningbo Intermediate People's Court said that his Chinese citizenship had been reinstated in 2018. China does not recognise dual citizenship.</p><p>Sweden's foreign minister on Tuesday called for Mr Gui's release, referring to him a "citizen".</p><p>"We have not had access to the trial," said Ann Linde in a tweet. "[We] demand that Gui be released and that we have access to our citizens to provide consular support."</p><p>But according to a Reuters report, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said consular arrangements had been put on hold because of the latest coronavirus outbreak, and would be restored once the health problem was "resolved".</p><p>Zhao Lijian added that Mr Gui's "rights and interests... [had] been fully guaranteed". </p><p>Human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday also called for Mr Gui to be released immediately and said the charges were "completely unsubstantiated".</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">A forced confession? </h2><p>Mr Gui first made headlines in 2015 when he vanished from Thailand and resurfaced in China.</p><p>After his disappearance, there were allegations that he had been abducted by Chinese agents. Chinese officials, however, say Mr Gui and the four other men all went to China voluntarily.</p><p>The bookseller ultimately confessed to being involved in a fatal traffic accident more than a decade earlier - a confession supporters say was forced.</p><p>He served two years in prison but he was arrested months after his release while he was travelling to the Chinese capital of Beijing with two Swedish diplomats.</p><p>China later released a video interview featuring Mr Gui. In it, he accused Sweden of "sensationalising" his case. It is not uncommon for Chinese criminal suspects to appear in "confessional" videos. </p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47238430" class="story-body__link">Sweden recalls China envoy over 'deal'</a></li></ul><p>Earlier in 2019, Sweden recalled its ambassador to China Anna Lindstedt, who was accused of brokering an unauthorised meeting between Angela Gui - the daughter of Mr Gui - and two Chinese businessmen.</p><p>Ms Gui - who has been vocal in campaigning for her father's release - said one of the men had pressured her to accept a deal where her father would go to trial and might be sentenced to "a few years" in prison, and in return she would stop all publicity around her father's detention.</p>
