His lawyers say he will appeal. </p><p>"I'm innocent. How can this happen in America?" Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala quoted his client as saying.</p><p>The former movie executive still faces charges in Los Angeles of assaulting two women in 2013.</p><p>In all, at least 80 women had accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek. Most of those complaints, however, have not led to criminal charges, as they are beyond the statute of limitations - meaning they happened too long ago.</p><p>The allegations were at the centre of the #MeToo movement that prompted women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men.</p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
